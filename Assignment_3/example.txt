The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long golden shadows across the quiet village. 
Childrenâ€™s laughter echoed through the narrow alleys as lanterns flickered to life one by one. 
A gentle breeze carried the scent of jasmine and distant rain, stirring memories of summers long past.
In this moment of peace, time seemed to pause, allowing the world to simply breathe and be still.
